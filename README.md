## iPhone E-Commerce Data Analysis
This project involves exploratory data analysis and feature engineering on a real-world e-commerce dataset of iPhones. Using Python and Pandas, we extracted insights to answer meaningful business questions commonly encountered in the e-commerce and retail analytics space.

### Tools & Libraries Used

    Python
    Pandas
    NumPy

### Key Tasks Performed

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
    Renamed columns for consistency (replaced spaces with underscores)
    Handled missing values in Star_Rating, first with global mean, then with RAM-specific mean

### Feature Engineering
    Extracted Color and iPhone Version from product names
